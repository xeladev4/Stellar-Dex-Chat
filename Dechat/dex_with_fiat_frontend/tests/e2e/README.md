## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
- Install Playwright browsers: `npm run test:e2e:install`

### Commands
- Run all tests: `npm run test:e2e`
- Run tests with UI: `npm run test:e2e:ui`
- Run tests in debug mode: `npm run test:e2e:debug`

### Individual Test Files
- Run wallet tests: `npm run test:e2e wallet-connect.spec.ts`
- Run deposit tests: `npm run test:e2e deposit-modal.spec.ts`
- Run payout tests: `npm run test:e2e payout-form.spec.ts`

## Test Configuration

The tests are configured in `playwright.config.ts` with:
- Multi-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Automatic server startup
- Screenshot capture on failure
- Trace collection for debugging
- HTML reporter

## Mocking

The tests use mocked Freighter wallet API to simulate:
- Wallet connection/disconnection
- Transaction signing
- Network detection
- Error scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **Add e2e test for connect wallet UI path**
✅ **Add e2e test for deposit modal validation and success state**
✅ **Add e2e test for payout form and mocked transfer initiation**

All tests provide clear validation output and cover both success and error scenarios for each feature.
